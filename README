NAME


File::chmod::Recursive - Run chmod recursively against directories



DESCRIPTION


Like [File::chmod][], but recursive with selective permissions



SYNOPSIS


    use File::chmod::Recursive;  # Exports 'chmod_recursive' by default

    # Apply identical permissions to everything
    #   Similar to chmod -R
    chmod_recursive( 0755, '/path/to/directory' );

    # Apply permissions selectively
    chmod_recursive(
        {
            dirs  => 0755,       # Mode for directories
            files => 0644,       # Mode for files

            # Match both directories and files
            match => {
                qr/\.sh|\.pl/ => 0755,
                qr/\.gnupg/   => 0600,
            },

            # You can also match files or directories selectively
            match_dirs  => { qr/\/logs\//    => 0775, },
            match_files => { qr/\/bin\/\S+$/ => 0755, },
        },
        '/path/to/directory'
    );



FUNCTIONS


-   chmod_recursive(MODE, $path)
-   chmod_recursive(\%options, $path)

    This function accepts two parameters. The first is either a _MODE_
    or an _options hashref_. The second is the directory to work on. It
    returns the number of files successfully changed, similar to
    [chmod][].

    When using a _hashref_ for selective permissions, the following
    options are valid -

        {
            dirs  => MODE,  # Default Mode for directories
            files => MODE,  # Default Mode for files

            # Match both directories and files
            match => { qr/<some condition>/ => MODE, },

            # Match files only
            match_files => { qr/<some condition>/ => MODE, },

            # Match directories only
            match_dirs => { qr/<some condition>/ => MODE, },

            # Follow symlinks. OFF by default
            follow_symlinks => 0,

            # Depth first tree walking. ON by default (default _find_ behavior)
            depth_first => 1,
        }

    In all cases the _MODE_ is whatever [File::chmod][] accepts.

-   rchmod
-   chmodr

    This is an alias for chmod_recursive and is exported only on
    request.
